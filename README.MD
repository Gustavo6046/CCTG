# CCTG: The future's free Peer-to-Peer gaming is close.

Peer to Peer is direct client connection, which while isn't exactly safer, is completely free and doesn't requires a paid server to work.

What makes this safe is that the client that starts it all is set as the "Host Client" and all other clients set him as... the host client. Without this, anyone could set the game state to anything they wanted.

## Instructions

Command-line parameters: `<client port>|[host <game name> <host port>] [<ip:port> [<ip:port> [...]]]`. Connect to a P2P network using the IPs. If you are to connect in a P2P network without a host and you declare yourself the host, then the host will become you.
